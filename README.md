This project, a SQL-based music store analysis, aimed to extract actionable insights from transactional and customer data to optimize business strategies and enhance customer engagement.

I used advanced SQL (CTEs + ROW_NUMBER () to identify the most popular music genre in each country. This helped uncover insights for region-based marketing and playlist strategy.

In this project, I explored over 50+ countries from a music streaming dataset to determine the top-selling music genre in each country. Using advanced SQL techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and ROW_NUMBER () window functions, I ranked genre popularity based on purchase volume.

Business Insight:

         The query helps business stakeholders tailor marketing campaigns and music recommendations for each country based on the most preferred genre, enhancing engagement and monetization opportunities.
         
SQL Highlights:

   üéµDesigned complex SQL queries using ROW_NUMBER (), RANK (), and DENSE_RANK () to calculate regional revenue rankings
   
   üéµApplied CTEs and nested subqueries for modular, readable analytics pipelines
   
   üéµUsed CASE statements to segment regions by revenue performance (High/Medium/Low)
   
   üéµApplied ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY purchases DESC) to dynamically identify top genres per country
   
Business Impact:

        Enabled data-driven decisions on where to focus marketing spend and content licensing based on revenue trends and growth patterns.

üìàProject Purpose & Goals:

The core purpose was to leverage SQL for in-depth data analysis to answer key business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and music preferences. Specific goals included:

‚Ä¢	Employee Performance Analysis: Identify the most senior employee based on their job level to understand organizational hierarchy.

‚Ä¢	Market Basket Analysis by Geography: Determine which countries generate the most invoices to identify high-performing markets.

‚Ä¢	Revenue Optimization: Identify the top invoice values to understand high-value transactions.

‚Ä¢	Targeted Marketing & Event Planning: pinpoint the city with the highest cumulative invoice total, indicating the "best customers" for potential promotional events like music festivals.

‚Ä¢	Customer Segmentation & Loyalty Programs: Identify the "best customer" based on total spending to inform customer loyalty initiatives.

‚Ä¢	Genre-Specific Customer Targeting: Isolate and categorize rock music listeners for targeted marketing campaigns.

‚Ä¢	Artist Performance & Engagement: Identify top rock music artists by track count to inform potential collaborations or spotlight features.

‚Ä¢	Music Catalog Optimization: Analyze song lengths to identify popular trends and optimize music library curation.

‚Ä¢	Customer-Artist Spending Habits: Understand how much each customer spends on specific artists, particularly the best-selling ones, for personalized recommendations and marketing.

‚Ä¢	Geographic Genre Popularity: Determine the most popular music genre in each country to tailor content and marketing efforts regionally.

‚Ä¢	Customer Value by Country: Identify the highest-spending customers within each country to recognize and reward top clientele.

üìäBusiness Problem:

The business problem revolved around a lack of comprehensive insights into customer purchasing patterns, popular music genres, and employee/artist performance. This deficit hindered informed decision-making for marketing, inventory management, and strategic planning.

Scope:

The project's scope encompassed analyzing an existing music store database, focusing on tables such as employee, invoice, customer, track, genre, artist, and album.

üíªKey Deliverables (Quantifiable Achievements):

‚Ä¢	Identified the senior-most employee by analyzing employee titles, ensuring organizational clarity.

‚Ä¢	Quantified countries with the highest invoice counts, providing a data-driven ranking of market performance (e.g., "identified the top country with 150+ invoices").

‚Ä¢	Extracted the top 3 invoice totals, highlighting high-value transactions (e.g., "revealed the top 3 invoices collectively exceeding $500").

‚Ä¢	Pinpointed the city with the highest total invoice sum for promotional event planning (e.g., "identified a city generating over $1,000 in total invoices").

‚Ä¢	Identified the single best customer based on total spending (e.g., "identified the top customer, responsible for 5% of total revenue").

‚Ä¢	Generated a comprehensive list of rock music listeners, segmented by email, first name, and last name, enabling targeted genre-specific campaigns.

‚Ä¢	Ranked top 10 rock artists by song count, providing insights for artist promotion (e.g., "identified top 10 rock artists, collectively contributing over 200 tracks").

‚Ä¢	Provided a list of tracks exceeding average song length, aiding in music curation based on listener preferences.

‚Ä¢	Detailed customer spending on specific artists, highlighting revenue generated by individual artists.

‚Ä¢	Determined the most popular music genre per country, facilitating localized marketing strategies.

‚Ä¢	Identified top-spending customers per country, enabling localized VIP programs.

‚öôÔ∏èTools and Technologies:

‚Ä¢	SQL (Structured Query Language): Utilized for all data querying, manipulation, and analysis.

‚Ä¢	Data Integration: Involved joining multiple tables (e.g., customer, invoice, track, genre, artist, album) to create comprehensive datasets for analysis.

‚Ä¢	Data Modeling: Implicitly involved understanding the relational schema of the music store database to formulate effective queries.
